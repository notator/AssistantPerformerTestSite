******************************************************************

To reduce latency, especially when performing live, use the Coolsoft VirtualMIDISynth and
set advanced options/additional output buffer (the last setting in the tab) to 0!

1 - Download "virtualmidisynth" from here http://coolsoft.altervista.org/en/virtualmidisynth (or look up the name in google)

2 - Download one of the free sound fonts suggested on that same page

3 - install VirtualMidisynth, and configure it as follow : 

- make it the default midi device

- add the soundfont you just downloaded to it

5 - in the advanced options tab, reduce the additional output buffer. I was able to reduce it to 0 without any adverse effects, your mileage may vary

6 - run synthesia and enjoy lag-free!
